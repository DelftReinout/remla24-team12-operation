## Comments for A1:
Here you can find the tag: [A1](https://github.com/killB0x/remla24-team12/releases/tag/A1). The corresponding repository contains a README file explaining how to run the project. 

We would be very happy to receive feeback on the following tasks:
  - Overall folder structure
  - Chosing pipenv as a dependency manager
  - The dvc pipeline (e.g. if the stages make sense)
  - Chosing dslinter for code quality
