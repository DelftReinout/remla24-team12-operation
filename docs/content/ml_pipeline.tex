% As part of the assignment on ML Config Management, you had to configure your training pipeline
% using best practices and tools. Document how your pipeline is set up and the decisions you had to make to configure your project (tools, design, workarounds, and so on). This should come along with a description of your pipeline, its different steps, the tasks you have automated, which artefacts are being created, and so on.
