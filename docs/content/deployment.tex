% Document the final deployment of your application.
% • Visualize the structure of the deployment (the entities and their connections).
% • The diagram should illustrate the data flow for incoming requests.
% • Include all resources that you have deployed in the cluster and their connections (not just the ones that are relevant for serving requests).
% • Clarify the visualization through a concise elaboration.

% Insufficient -> The deployment documentation is incomprehensible or incomplete.
% Sufficient -> The deployment documentation is limited to the structure of the deployment (the entities and their connections) or the data flow for incoming requests. The documentation visualizes the deployment and connects the text.
% Good -> The deployment documentation describes both the structure of the deployment (the entities and their connections) and the data flow for incoming requests.
% Very Good -> The deployment documentation includes all deployed resource types and relations.
% Excellent -> The deployment documentation is visually appealing and clear. It is easy for a new team member to understand and to start contributing to the described system.

% Interesting visualization tool:
